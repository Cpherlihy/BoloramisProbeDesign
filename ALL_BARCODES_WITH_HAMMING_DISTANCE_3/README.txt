This file contains all possible 8 nt barcodes with a hamming distance of 3.
You can use this as your main barcode source and it will automatically update the barcode.txt file in the root dir when it assigns a new barcode to a new target.
The script will throw a dict error if you assign the same target with two different barcodes.
