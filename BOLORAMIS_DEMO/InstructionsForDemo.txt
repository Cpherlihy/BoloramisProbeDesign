This is a demo using real targets in our experiment, with step by step instructions on using these scripts.
To start, please copy-paste the files in "BOLORAMIS_DEMO" into the root dir

1. Download "gencode.v29.transcripts.fa" from Gencode
2. Index genome using Bowtie2
	COMMAND: bowtie2-build --threads 4 gencode.v29.transcripts.fa gencode.v29.transcripts.fa 
3. Copy-paste those files into a folder names "REFERENCE" along with "gencode.v29.transcripts.fa"
4. File "BoloramisDemoTargets.txt" contains the transcript ID of the targets, one per line. The following command extracts the fasta sequences of the targets in this file.
	COMMAND: python3 0_PullTargetsFromReference.py -i BoloramisDemoTargets.txt -o BoloramisDemoTargets.fasta -r ./REFERENCE/gencode.v29.transcripts.fa
	where -o is the output of the transcript sequences in fasta format and -r is the reference database.
5. We now want to predict all possible probes while minimizing offtarget hybridization using bowtie2.
	COMMAND: python3 1_DesignProbesAndRunOfftargetPrediction.py -i BoloramisDemoTargets.fasta -r ./REFERENCE/gencode.v29.transcripts.fa
	Output is automatically placed in the 'part1' folder.
6. Now, let's attach barcodes. adapters, and make sure none of the probes overlap.
	COMMAND: python3 2_AssembleProbes.py
	All Probes are automatically output to the 'probes' folder. The important files have '_FinalProbes.fasta' appended to the end. The other files are intermediate files that may be important to you. The 'FinalTargets.fasta' appended files has the site of probe hydridizations, and the '_PostBowtie.fasta'-appended files are all probes that passed the bowtie step, but not ranked by secondary structure or checked for 2+ probes hybridizing to an overlapping site.
	E.g., ADAM7_6off_FinalTargets.fasta and ADAMTS1_6off_FinalProbes.fasta hold your results.
	To quickly summarize your results, look at the summary_file_6off.txt. This file lists all targets and the number of probes designed for each.
